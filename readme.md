# Coding Assignment Solution - Grant Moss - October 10, 2022

Steps for running the code:

1. Create a sub folder called `/data` in the project root and add the following files `/data/state_IL_application.csv` and `/data/X_test.xlsx`.
2. Make sure that both `model_gm.ipynb` and `util.py` are in the project root. The `model_gm.ipynb` imports code from `util.py`.
3. Create the virtual environment specified in `environment.yml`. In the project root, run: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. Open jupyter notebook, navigate to `model_gm.ipynb` and run!


Model output is saved in `X_test_predicted_gm.csv`
